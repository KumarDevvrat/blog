Much to the theme of quintessential programmer's kit, a blog is a must have (I kid, I kid!) 

- I have attempted blogging multiple times. Initially, it was in the in days of [Blogspot](http://blogspot.com/). Now I look at one those posts and curl in up in my bed with cringe. I guess that's how internet memory works

- Thereafter, I wrote a lot of 
posts on devvrat.in 6-8 years ago (not active with me anymore). The site was hosted on [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) and it was quite an easy peasy task to pen down things. Unfortunately, the free hosting server got hacked due to an exploit in [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/)

- I used to post write-ups on SharpDevelop community blog. Those were related to the work in the project

- There was this new kid on the block [medium.com](https://www.medium.com). It made everything too easy. No theme management. No spam filter configuration. Comment system auto-enabled. What good times!

- There was a set of parallel posts in [Github pages](http://kumardevvrat.github.io). I am finally reviving this one as I want to give a personal touch to my thoughts and writing. Plus I am not a huge fan of medium's font

Initially the idea was to pen down thoughts and create a life's log to say. However, I also wish to utilize this as a form of personal learning as I present my thoughts in an articulate manner. It's sort of a written version of famous [Feynman learning technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/)

As of now, I don't wish to pollute with set of ideas around blogging. We will pave the road as we walk along
