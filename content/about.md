I currently work as software architect in a software-first robotics company

At the same time, it's futile to define myself with a title. I think it won't do justice to many aspects of life. Professionally, I have shades of programmer, 
software engineer, management, leadership, hustler, software architect and couple of other things. I like to believe that I am good at solving problems from first-class principles
There is long list of things I have to learn or be good at, which means I am nowhere near the perfection I aim for

Problems with actual use-case excite me. I have keen interest in R&D, with equal emphasis on prototyping and developing. I take interest in
- Software architecture
- Distributed systems
- Networks and communication
- Microservice architecture
- Kernel design
- Programming language design

Personally, I like photography, travelling and programming. I also take immense interest in reading about astrophysics. My interests have often evolved and drifted. I am sure I am missing some of them

#### Random thoughts

- I declare with full acceptance that I am addicted to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com)
- Concepts are more important than technologies nitty-gritties but a healthy balance needs to be there
- Performance is not an add-on, it's can be a feature itself
- Mathematical reasoning is far more important than variational calculus in real life
- Canon, nikon and others are charging far too much because the market is willing to pay for it

I will keep appending few more or put them in a separate blog post if the list becomes huge
